Functional:

Riders can request a ride.
Drivers can accept ride requests.
The system matches the closest available driver to a rider.
Riders and drivers can cancel at any time.
Surge pricing logic must be supported for areas with high demand.

Non-Functional:

Low latency for matching (under 2 seconds).
High availability and fault tolerance.
Scalable to support global traffic.
Handle concurrency issues properly (e.g., two drivers trying to accept the same ride).
