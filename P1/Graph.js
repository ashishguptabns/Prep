/* Number of Nodes in the Sub-Tree With the Same Label - You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and exactly n - 1 edges. The root of the tree is the node 0, and each node of the tree has a label which is a lower-case character given in the string labels (i.e. The node with the number i has the label labels[i]).

The edges array is given on the form edges[i] = [ai, bi], which means there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.

Return an array of size n where ans[i] is the number of nodes in the subtree of the ith node which have the same label as node i.
